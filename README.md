# AEM WKND Muzik Site

This is a project template for AEM-based applications. It is intended as a best-practice set of examples as well as a potential starting point to develop your own functionality.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* core: Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* it.tests: Java based integration tests
* ui.apps: contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS&CSS clientlibs, components, and templates
* ui.content: contains sample content using the components from the ui.apps
* ui.config: contains runmode specific OSGi configs for the project
* ui.frontend: an optional dedicated front-end build mechanism (Angular, React or general Webpack project)
* ui.tests: Selenium based UI tests
* all: a single content package that embeds all of the compiled modules (bundles and content packages) including any vendor dependencies
* analyse: this module runs analysis on the project which provides additional validation for deploying into AEMaaCS

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

To build all the modules and deploy the `all` package to a local instance of AEM, run in the project root directory the following command:

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackagePublish

Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

Or to deploy only a single content package, run in the sub-module directory (i.e `ui.apps`)

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

## ClientLibs

The frontend module is made available using an [AEM ClientLib](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/clientlibs.html). When executing the NPM build script, the app is built and the [`aem-clientlib-generator`](https://github.com/wcm-io-frontend/aem-clientlib-generator) package takes the resulting build output and transforms it into such a ClientLib.

A ClientLib will consist of the following files and directories:

- `css/`: CSS files which can be requested in the HTML
- `css.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `css/` so they can be merged)
- `js/`: JavaScript files which can be requested in the HTML
- `js.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `js/` so they can be merged
- `resources/`: Source maps, non-entrypoint code chunks (resulting from code splitting), static assets (e.g. icons), etc.
